		<h1>My Super Dope Web Page</h1>
		<p>Hi, this is my super awesome web page where the content makes no sense but there is a lot of it. So let's get into some business that you can learn from</p>

		<h3>This is a list of colots that are coloful in no particular order:</h3>

 			width="250"

 			<h3>Sometimes people say important things</h3>

 			<p>You need to document importatn things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary</p>
 			<p>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - <cite>Bill Gates</cite></p>

 			<h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
 			
 			<p>At least, not anymore...</p>
 			
 			<h4>Want bold text?</h4>
 			
 			<p>There's a <b>wrong way</b> and a <strong>right way</strong>. Always us the <strong>right way!</strong></p>

 			<h4>Maybe you need some italics?</h4>

 			<p>Again, it used to be done <i>like this</i>. <i>This</i> is wrong. <em>This</em> is the <em>right</em> way.</p>

 			<h4>Seperation of concerns</h4>

 			<p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up of organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>

 			<h2>Links</h2>

 			<p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to <a href="https://www.google.com">place</a> on the internet</p>

 			<h2>Sections</h2>

 			<p>Sections elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this.</p>
